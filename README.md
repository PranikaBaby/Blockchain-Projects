1)Lottery Smart Contract

Description:

The provided Solidity code represents a simple lottery smart contract. Participants can join the lottery by sending 1 ether, and the manager can pick a winner when there are at least 3 players. The winner is selected based on a pseudo-random number generated using a combination of block data.


Tools Used:

Solidity: The programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
Sepolia Testnet: A fictional test network mentioned in your question. You can replace it with an actual Ethereum testnet, such as Goerli,Rinkeby, Ropsten, or Kovan, for testing purposes.


Lottery Algorithm:

Participants join by calling the participate function and sending 1 ether.
The manager, who is the contract deployer, can check the contract balance using the getbalance function.
The manager can pick a winner using the pickWinner function, which requires at least 3 participants.
The winner is selected based on a pseudo-random number generated by the random function, and the entire contract balance is transferred to the winner.


Code Explanation:


The Solidity code defines a lottery smart contract where participants send 1 ether to join, and the manager can pick a winner.
The contract stores the manager's address, participant addresses, and the winner's address as state variables.
The participate function adds participants to the array, and getbalance allows the manager to check the contract balance.
The random function generates a pseudo-random number based on block data and player count.
The pickWinner function, accessible only to the manager, selects a winner and transfers the entire balance to them when there are at least 3 participants.
